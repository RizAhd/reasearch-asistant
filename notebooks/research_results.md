**Query:** What is artificial intelligence?

## Answer
Quantum computing is a type of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform operations. Here is an explanation based on the provided sources:

- **Quantum Computer Operation**: Quantum computers work by exploiting superposed and entangled states. This means they can operate on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, unlike classical computers which operate based on deterministic rules [1].
  
- **Quantum Advantage**: Quantum computing offers substantial processing advantages over traditional computing due to its ability to utilize entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts. These features enable quantum computers to solve complex problems that may be unsolvable with classical computers [3].
  
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing**: There is a concept of hybrid quantum-classical computing where quantum algorithms are combined with classical computing techniques. This approach is designed for compositional algorithms that involve both quantum and classical components [2].

It is important to note that the field of quantum computing is still evolving and there are ongoing research and development efforts to harness its full potential.

- **Preview:** A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that exploits superposed and entangled states. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary ("classical") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechani...
